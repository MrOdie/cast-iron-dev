# React Project
For a long time I have been a huge fan of React. I've tarried on with a variety of different front end frameworks and libraries ranging from Jekyll, to Angular, to React, to Gatsby, to NextJS, and even Svelte and Vue. My favorite by far has been React and I've done the most with it in either Gatsby or NextJS. It's been edifying and challenging along the way and I am looking forward to working out the kinks as I trudge forward.
