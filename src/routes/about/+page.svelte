        <p>I am a self taught Software Engineer with 6.5 years of experience, ranging from every end of web app development and even delving into a bit of DevOps.</p>
        <p>I enjoy learning new technologies and diving into the next big thing, whether that's GatsbyJS years ago or SvelteKit and Supabase today.</p>
        <p>In my free time I enjoy spending time with my children and wife, collectively and individually.</p>
        <p>I am passionate about what I do and strive to improve myself daily.</p>
