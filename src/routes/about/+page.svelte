        <h3 class="text-lg mb-2">From Education to Technology</h3>
        <p>I graduated from college in the fall of 2014 with a Bachelor's of Arts in Philosophy and Catholic Studies and fell into teaching.</p>
        <p>It only took 3 years of teaching to realize that I did not want to do this forever, so I began to gauge my interests.</p>
        <p>It was not long before I settled on tech. Within a span of 11 months, my wife and I uprooted our family, left our jobs, moved across the country, welcomed out second child, and I started my first tech job.</p>
        <p>I started off doing Front End related work in Automotive Digital Transformation before moving into the DOD.</p>
        <p>While working in the DOD, I was previledged to work on Medal of Honor sites, building out web portals for a NASA department that was reminiscent of Uber Pool</p>
